Kyndra, Cassandra, and Jessica are playing Settlers of Cataan (see image: http://www.anotherdungeon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screenshot-Catan-5.jpg) It’s the start of Jessica’s turn (White). She decides to bet Kyndra (Red) that fewer than two stone cards will be distributed this turn, and puts $100 on the line. Cassandra, being a master of predicting outcomes, then says “You should take the bet, but only put up a maximum of ______ if you want your pot odds to be good.”
