Jan and Sven are the two greatest Jenga players in the world. They decide to play a game of Jenga following all the normal rules, but add these additional rules to make it more challenging: Both players must always pull from the lowest possible level on the tower. Neither player is allowed to pull middle pieces. After an hour of intense play, the game ends in a draw when there are no legal pulls left, but the tower is still standing. How many levels high is the tower?
