Nolanâ€™s Cell~
As you step into this room, you can't help but feel like there's someone else in here. You look around, but something heavy hits you in the back of the head, and you find yourself in the first room again. 

Daedalus' voice echoes from the ceiling. 

"Your avatar got deleted? That wasn't meant to be an instant-death room. Odd. Likely a malfunction. Just avoid that room from now on, alright, Player?"

You groan. "Malfunction," your virtual foot.
