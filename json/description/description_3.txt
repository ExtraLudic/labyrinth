Fibonacci's Cell~
This cell is cramped and lit by orange torchlight. Two narrow walls lean in toward you and form a long, curving corridor. You follow it, feeling the rough stone against your fingertips and find yourself spiraling ever further inward as the pathway grows narrower and darker. “Have you ever wondered what the difference between a maze and a labyrinth is?” Daedalus’s voice asks as you come to stop. “Oh well. Probably not important.”

Your hands feel an irregularity in the wall: a smooth surface that bursts to life with your touch. It is a screen, offering three ways forward.
