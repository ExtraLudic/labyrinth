Spielberg's Cell~
You step into the room, and instantly feel the sensation of falling. This room was emptier, even, than all the others of this collection of nodes--there is not only no walls or ceiling, there is no floor. As you fall, however, your descent become more and more gradual. After a moment, your feet touch solid ground again, and you realise you were closing your eyes. You open them, and--you're back in the first room. 

You groan.
