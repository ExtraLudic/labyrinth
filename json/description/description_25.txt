Kubrick's Cell~
Stars seem to fly by at an alarming rate - but of course they are not really stars, just points of white light, probably data packets skimming across Daedalusâ€™s neural net. BRUCE is here, and you greet him with a wave.  With his characteristic enthusiasm, he spins on his heel to face you, and salutes. You ask what BRUCE was doing, and he seems as though he's struggling to find a way to phrase it.

"I was looking at THESE data packets. Everything we do GENERATES one for Daedalus to ANALYZE. But we PERSONALITIES are made of DATA. So I can't HELP but feel the HUMAN equivalent would be chunks of FLESH flying through space."

You attempt to un-hear that, and leave the room.
