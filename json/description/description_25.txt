Kubrick's Cell~
Stars seem to fly by at an alarming rate - but of course they are not really stars, just points of white light, probably data packets skimming across Daedalusâ€™s neural net. 

BRUCE is watching them, eyes narrowed, as though they think the data packets may be dangerous. You greet BRUCE with a wave. With their characteristic enthusiasm, they spin on their heel to face you, and salute.

"Player! I'm ready to serve."

You ask what BRUCE was doing, and they seem as though they're struggling to find a way to phrase it.

"I was looking at THESE data packets. Everything we do GENERATES one for Daedalus to ANALYZE. But we PERSONALITIES are made of DATA. So I can't HELP but feel the HUMAN equivalent would be chunks of FLESH flying through space."

You are disturbed, and your ears hurt, but you are intrigued to hear how BRUCE thinks.

"WELL, no use WASTING time here. I'VE got a BOGEY to find."

You ask BRUCE if they've had any luck.

"Well, PIPER told me to look up my NOSE. So I'm LOOKING for a mirror."

You decide to leave BRUCE alone.
