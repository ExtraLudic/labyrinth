Kant’s Cell~
Your ears pop and you sense that you are deep underground. Faint green light emanates from the walls and ceilings where bioluminescent fungi cling like ivy. There is a rumble from someplace deep. Mounting pressure and stale air make you feel claustrophobic. Panic begins to set in as you see no way forward. There is another rumble, louder, that shakes you. You listen for Daedalus’s instructions, but none come. Debris begins to fall, and the bioluminesce wink out. The tunnel collapses and everything becomes black.
