Garfield’s’ Cell~

This round, room is adorned with noble columns and comprises a series of marble archways in different colors: red, black, and blue, plus the white one that you materialized in. In the center is a chest-high plinth. Carved onto the surface is an intricate map of a neural network and the latin words: “Videre map quando scribunt map.”

You know you can’t go back the way you came, but you have a funny feeling that this room should have five archways, not four, and wonder why there’s one missing.
