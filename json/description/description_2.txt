Descartes’ Cell~
You step into a cell with wrought-iron walls. The floor is made of similarly-rough metal, and upon, leaning down and touching it with your hand, flakes of rust slough off, revealing shinier metal underneath. You scrape away at the small indent you made in the floor, but the metal beneath seems to be completely invulnerable to any form of degradation--which leads you to wonder how the rust formed in the first place. After a moment, your eyes widen with horror, as you realise you can see the rust slowly spreading to fill the hole you opened up. You quickly glance at your watch, and see that rust has started to cover it, as well. It’s definitely time to get out of this cell.
