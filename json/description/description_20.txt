Kojimaâ€™s Cell~
This room is an extremely long corridor with walls that start as marble at one end, and fades to some sort of white metal by the other end. The squat Personality you saw before in the lounge is standing just a few feet away from the door.

"PLAYER!" it bellows. "My name is BRUCE! I was HOPING you'd come along SOON. I am responsible for this LABYRINTH'S security, and would like to ASK for your help in KEEPING an eye out for any suspicious folk. THERE probably aren't ANY, but it never hurts to be WATCHFUL!"

Your ears are starting to hurt, so you nod and move on.
