Gygax’s Cell~
This cell is eerily quiet, and alive with blue light. Walls, two sheets of spotless glass, loom upward to infinity on either side of you. Behind them is fluorescent blue water teeming with strange life. What appears to be myriad fish and clouds of jellies reveal themselves upon closer examination to be packets of data -- digits and bits stylized into the forms of electric blue sea fauna. They swirl together, suggesting paths to other cells. A sharp crack that sounds like breaking glass heralds the arrival of Daedalus’ voice, once again coming from some unknown location. 
“Ah, Player. I hope that sound didn’t startle you too much. It’s conceivable that you would think that sound was the shattering of the walls, yes? Well, you need not fear. The “you” present within my labyrinth is only a digital avatar, after all. This labyrinth is entirely safe to anyone lucky enough to inhabit the physical world. Carry on.”
