Gygax’s Cell~
A deep, dread cold washes over you as you enter this chamber. The long, wide corridor is paved with multicolored stones that compose a strange fresco. At the end of the hallways is the horrible face of a green devil, its mouth a wide open passageway shrouded in impenetrable blackness. To its left is a misty archway studded with glimmering colored gems. You quickly realize that touching the gems in a specific order will yield passage to different areas, but stepping through will be a blind gamble. The alternative, the green devil’s mouth, is even less inviting.
