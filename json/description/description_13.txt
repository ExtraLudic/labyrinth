Knizia’s Cell~
This room is decorated in the style of an ancient Egyptian tomb with incredible frescos completely covering the walls. As you walk, you feel the floor scuffing and tearing under your feet and realize it’s made of loosely fitted cardboard tiles. You touch a figure of an eagle-headed human on the wall and find it too is made of cardboard colored by a glossy print. 

“Tombs like this were designed to be the ultimate final resting place for Pharaohs and their favored followers,” you hear Daedalus announce. “Although many such tombs have been unearthed by archaeologists many more remain sealed and filled with untold treasures. Perhaps they will remain sealed forever.”
