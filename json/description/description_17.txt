Kanai’s Cell~
You discover your clothes have changed. You’re adorned in fine velvets and a large lace ruff rings your collar. The room is peopled by a group of other figures, similarly dressed -- mostly as if for a fancy party in 1781, but some appear to be guards, priests, and magistrates as well. A beautiful woman wearing a royal-looking tiara approaches you, thrusting an envelope into your hand.

“Shh,” she hisses. “No one must see us. Hide this and don’t let them take it from you!”

As she breaks away from you to warmly greet another woman, a priest gives you a dark look. You glance down at the envelope, and see it’s sealed with red wax. “Ash” is written on the front in an ornate script.
