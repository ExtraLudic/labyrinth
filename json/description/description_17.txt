Kanai’s Cell~
You discover your clothes have changed. You’re adorned in fine velvets and a large lace ruff rings your collar. The room is peopled by a group of other figures, similarly dressed -- mostly as if for a fancy party in 1781, but some appear to be guards, priests, and magistrates as well. A beautiful, but stony-faced woman wearing a royal-looking tiara approaches you, thrusting an envelope into your hand.

Out of the side of her mouth she whispers, “Do not let anyone see this. I can't have the rabble know I am indebted to a human--and a peasant human at that." 

You don't recognize the woman. What did she mean by being indebted to you?

"I'm IVANESSA, lack-wit. Just like you, our appearances change when we enter different rooms. I must extend to you my grudging thanks for permitting our departure--as much as it pains me. Now, hide this, and don’t let one of the rabble take it from you.”

As she breaks away from you to greet another woman, a priest gives you a dark look. You glance down at the envelope, and see it’s sealed with red wax. “Ash” is written on the front in an ornate script. Something tells you you shouldn't try to open it.
