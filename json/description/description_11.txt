Tajiri’s Cell~
The room you step into is very, very different from anything you’ve encountered so far. The walls are padded with colorful fabric, with bright primary-colored pillows tossed about haphazardly. In the center of the room, atop what looks like a pile of children’s blankets, there lies an egg. The egg is large, about the size of an ostrich’s, and pastel patterns decorate the outside--you see a heart, a star, a teddy bear, and other such childlike symbols. As you approach the egg, careful not to trip over the numerous stuffed animals strewn about the nursery, a mobile descends from the ceiling, turning slightly on its axis. Hanging from the mobile is a tv screen, which begins to show another video.

As the mobile draws back into the ceiling, Daedalus’ voice booms out once more, saying, “Welcome to the second major node of my neural net. The problems being posed to you are about to get harder and the answers won’t be so obvious. And the map will become more important, so do not neglect it.”

“I suppose you may have noticed a hidden channel in your slack channel called #tamagotchi? If you haven’t joined it yet, you probably should. Oh, and take that egg with you.”
