Clarke’s Cell~
As you enter this room, Daedalus says, “You have reached the core of my artificial brain. IVANESSA will be very helpful to you from now on--as the Personality in charge of my virtual architecture, she can help you avoid getting lost as my labyrinth becomes more abstract.”

One of the Personalities--the womanly-figured one that had been arguing with Bruce--steps up.

"Player. From now on, the architecture of this labyrinth will be actively working against you. I have little patience for fools, and I have no intention of mollycoddling. Keep your wits about you, and our relationship should be a fruitful one."
