Xeno’s Cell~
A hot wind and the smell of ozone greets you. Circuitry crackles in the distance, impossibly large, as if you are a single atom inside a great quantum processor. Perhaps you are.

“Congratulations!” 

Daedalus’s voice seems to boom from nowhere and everywhere.

“You have completed the first node of my network. I thank you.”

There is a hum, then he continues.

“Oh, you look confused. You haven’t guessed then?”

“I thought it would be obvious from the map that my labyrinth is no labyrinth at all. You have been navigating my neural network this entire time, building me as you travel and solve my puzzles together. But you’ve only scratched the surface. Finding this cell was your first task, but many more remain to be solved. From here you can transfer to two other nodes. Choose whichever you like, but know there is only one correct path through my network.”
