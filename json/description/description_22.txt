Cameron’s’ Cell~
TMenacing red lights slowly pulse in the murky distance in this room. It is difficult to tell where you end and the space begins. Your thoughts stray to self preservation. Suddenly, a hand grabs your shoulder, and your vision clears.

"Fool," a familiar voice hisses. It's IVANESSA. "You never enter this room alone. Without someone to ground you, your avatar will unhinge from the physics engine and likely corrupt."

You ask what the purpose is of having a room like that in the labyrinth.

"The same reason there are all those other instant-death rooms in here. It's meant to be challenging for a human. Deadliness towards Personalities is not considered in the creation of these rooms."

You ask why, then, IVANESSA was in this room.

"To protect imbeciles like BRUCE or you from getting torn apart here. PIPER might wander in here--they don't know the layout of the Labyrinth. BENEDICT has been acting forgetful recently, so they might wander in here as well. Essentially, SIGURD is the only person I trust to not delete themself. What a group I've surrounded myself with..."

Muttering curses to themselves, IVANESSA leads you to the door at the other end of the room. Though there is not a single kind word in anything they're saying, you notice that their grip on your shoulder has not lessened at all. You wonder if IVANESSA will consider the debt repaid yet.
