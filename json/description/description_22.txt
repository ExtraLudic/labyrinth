Cameron’s’ Cell~
Menacing red lights slowly pulse in the murky distance in this room. It is difficult to tell where you end and the space begins. Your thoughts stray to self preservation. Suddenly, a hand grabs your shoulder, and your vision clears.

"Do you lack brains?" a familiar voice hisses. It's IVANESSA. "You never enter this room alone. Without someone to ground you, your avatar will unhinge from the physics engine and likely corrupt."

You thank IVANESSA, and quickly leave the room.
