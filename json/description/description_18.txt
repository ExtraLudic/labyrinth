Wrightâ€™s Cell
~This room is an empty grey void. Fog surrounds you on all sides, and your vision becomes effectively useless ten feet away from your body. From the mist, Daedalus' voice echoes.

"Player, it is time I introduce you to your companions for the rest of this maze. They should be in this room." 

You look forward, and, indeed, see five vaguely human-shaped shadows standing before you. The one in the center is very tall, and standing closer to you than the others.

"Player," it begins, with a surprisingly deep voice, "My name is SIGURD, and I am the Head Personality of Daedalus' Personality sub-systems. We Personalities will all do our best to aid you in your quest. You will likely see us throughout the labyrinth."

With that, the Personalities file out of the room, with a smaller one at the end of the line turning back to wave at you.
