Plato’s Cell~
Doors slam shut behind as you enter, and you find yourself in a cave-like room. The walls appear to be natural stone, moist with condensation. Stalactites droop from overhead, and you half expect to see slumbering bats above, but no. You are alone here. The smell of smoke fills your nostrils. Surprisingly, this chamber is lit by bright orange firelight, which casts dancing shadows on the wall. You see sparks flickering up from the flame and drifting toward the cave’s ceiling, but instead of going out, they collect there. Gradually, then in a torrent, the sparks light up in a constellation of letters and numbers that finally become legible.

“2 R1S3 0Ut 0f th3 d@rk, cl1mb uP0n 7h3 5h0uld3r5 0f g1An75,” is written there.

The cave stretches out before you forming three forks, three more ways you can go. None look especially inviting, and light emanates from each: one orange, one green, one blue.
