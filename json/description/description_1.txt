Socrates’ Cell~
You find yourself in a rumbling chamber with metal walls. You feel you are descending. The space is dimly lit, as if you’re on an elevator running on emergency power. A flash of blue light sputters to life casting the cell in pale illumination and a video appears before your eyes, stretched across the entire ceiling. As the video plays, a mechanical, synthesized voice narrates over the imagery….
