Locke’s Cell~
You enter a circular room with a low ceiling. Grates cover the ceiling in an interlocking pattern, several meters tall, so that even though the holes between the bars are fairly wide, you can’t see anything past a meter or so into the ceiling. As you stare upwards, Daedalus’ voice booms from speakers hidden somewhere in the labyrinth. “Admiring the architecture, Player? Rooms like these used to be used in dungeons, where a person could be put into a room with a ceiling that would allow liquids to be poured down into it. Water, oil, molten metals… no need for that sort of activity in this labyrinth, of course. You aren’t physically here, after all, and your digital avatar cannot be harmed. Carry on, now.”
