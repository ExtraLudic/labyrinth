Bessonâ€™s Cell~

You barely get a second to look around this room before BENEDICT rushes up to you.

"Heya, hey! Great to see you. C'mon, door's over here, let's go, go, go!"

You take a quick look around, and see a grid of copper wires that seem to be inlaid into some invisible floor. They glow slightly at uneven intervals.

"Hey, buddy. There's nothing to see here--the big guy shut off all the pretty stuff. It's just barebones representations of hardware and software. So let's get a move on--this stuff isn't worth hanging around for."

You shrug, and approach the door, with BENEDICT hovering behind you.
