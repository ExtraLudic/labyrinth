Persson’s Cell~

You enter a room that looks like a hunting lodge. A Personality spots you, and waves you over.

"Hey, human! I'm BENEDICT. Hope you don't mind that we're taking a little break."

When you look over BENEDICT's shoulder, you see a squat Personality and a womanly-figured Personality bent over a card game. They seem to be arguing.

"They think one of them has a card up their sleeves."

Another Personality walks up behind you--a short one, that skips as it walks.

"Hee hee," it says. "I tricked 'em! Actually, I nicked the card before I gave them the deck. You’ll need to be clever like me to solve these puzzles. Like the Tamagotchi… it doesn’t understand normal language.”

BENEDICT winks at you, and flashes a card--a Seven of Clubs.

"That's PIPER. She's a little prankster. Anyway, we can take a break, but you can't--so hurry up, human!”
