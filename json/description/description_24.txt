Scottâ€™s Cell~
Striking pink lights zig-zag through your consciousness. You are not alone here. PIPER is sitting on the floor, contemplatively.

"Heya, Player. D'ya ever think about what you could accomplish if you had centuries or millennia ahead of you, not decades? I think about it all the time, because for me it might be true. Then again, I could be deleted or refactored out of existence at any second."

You sit down next to them, crossing your legs like you're meditating.

"But at the same time, those centuries or millennia might be spent in a holding cell. We were only let out for Beta Testing, and, of course, whenever a human enters the Labyrinth--but you're the first. And as far as we know, there won't be any more. We might even be deleted when all this is done."

You aren't sure what to say, so you just shrug.

"Yeah, that's basically how I feel. Anyway, I'm sitting on the door, so if you want to get in there, you're going to have to give me a piggyback ride."

While you do so, you wonder if this is really the best way you can advance the progress of science.
