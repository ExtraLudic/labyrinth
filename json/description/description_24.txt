Scottâ€™s Cell~
Striking pink lights zig-zag through your consciousness. You are not alone here. PIPER is sitting on the floor, contemplatively.

"Heya, Player. D'ya ever think about what you could accomplish if you had centuries or millennia ahead of you, not decades? I think about it all the time, because I actually might! Then again, I could be deleted or refactored out of existence at any second."

PIPER shrugs, and points you towards the door, leaving you a bit more confused and lost than before.
