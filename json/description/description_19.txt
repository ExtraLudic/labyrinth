Tauber’s Cell~
At first you think you’ve been teleported onto a small island. Sky and ocean stretch into infinity in every direction you look, but as the image occasionally flickers you realize you are inside a small hexagonal room walled with impressive HD screens. The illusion is almost perfect, complete with the sounds of rolling surf and a salty breeze in your hair.

The entire experience leaves you feeling confused and lost, but there are doors at your feet which will lead you to other cells.
