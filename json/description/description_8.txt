Heidegger’s Cell
~You step into a room that is completely spherical, so you lose your balance and nearly twist your ankle as you warp in. The sphere seems to be made of bolted-together brass, and the entire room seems to shake slightly when you knock against a wall, as though the sphere were suspended in midair, somehow. After a few moments pass, you hear what sounds like a deep, electric hum, and you see that a few of the bolts in the sphere are vibrating in their holes. Looking down on your wrist, you see that your watch’s compass is careening wildly from north to south and east to west. You quickly seek a way out of the room.
