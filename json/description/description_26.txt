Vonnegut’s Cell~BENEDICT is standing in this room, sipping something from a can. The logo on the can is too pixelated to make out.

"Hey, Human. Want a drink? ...Oh, right. You can't taste it. Mea culpa. Probably shouldn't be drinking this crap anyway... sugar overload, eh? Just can't resist... Daedalus is going to fix that, you know. He's going to figure out how to solve mankind's biggest problems. You're the beta tester for a world where humans are free from their own vices... I envy you a bit. But don't tell the big man!"

“Oh,” he adds. “And if you’re still working on the tamagachi puzzle, have you tried using emojis?”
