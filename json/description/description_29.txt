Wachowskiâ€™s Cell~
When you step into this room, you feel as though you have walked into a disco ball, or a kaleidoscope. Every wall is slanted in a direction impossible for euclidean geometry, and every surface seems to strobe through three different colors, none of which you can name. There doesn't appear to be anyone else here--though if there were, it would be very hard to tell, so you look around for a vaguely door-shaped polygon, and approach it.
