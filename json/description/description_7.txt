Von Glasserfeldâ€™s Cell~
The cell you just stepped into is absolutely frigid. Rough stone lines the walls and ceiling, and large cracks have split the rock in multiple places, creating a web of rocky fractures that seem to travel across the walls like serpents. Each fracture is filled with ice so dense it has turned turquoise, though there appear to pulses of light traveling behind the walls, as though illuminated fish lived in water within the ice. You know there can be no water, though--the cold makes it painful to even approach the walls for too long.
